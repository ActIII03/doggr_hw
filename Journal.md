- 04/13:
- Worked on PUT, POST verbs:
  - I first setup the route and router to handle PUT request before moving on to minimal() and finally app.put() in server.
  - I assumed this is the optimal workflow for adding HTTP verbs.
  - I got a successful PUT for "/" and "/about".
  - For POST, I followed the same flow, route() --> router() --> server.js
