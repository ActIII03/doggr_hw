  - Worked on PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH verbs:
    - I first setup the route and router to handle PUT request before moving on to minimal() and finally app.put() in server.
    - I assumed this is the optimal workflow for adding HTTP verbs.
    - I got a successful PUT for "/" and "/about".
    - For POST, I followed the same flow, route() --> router() --> server.js
    - For DELETE, I followed the same flow, route() --> router() --> server.js
    - For PATCH, I followed the same flow, route() --> router() --> server.js
